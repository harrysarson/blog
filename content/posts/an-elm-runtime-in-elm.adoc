= An elm runtime written in elm
Harry Sarson
2019-11-22, elm 0.19.1

NOTE: I am writing this post in response to a comment on my link:./2019-11-21-why-platform-must-define-task.md[last post] suggesting that, as a platform-y thing, the elm runtime should be written platform specific code.

The elm runtime must do three things:

. Detect external, asynchronous events.
. [[inform-elm-app]] Inform the elm application about these detected events by passing it information describing the event.
. Perform actions as requested by the elm application.

In response to the runtime, the elm application must

. Update its state.
. Instruct the runtime to perform actions.
. Inform the runtime about which asynchronous events it should be detecting.

The diagram below summarises these interactions.
My claim is that most of the work done by the elm runtime consists of piping data between the various components.
I have marked in blue ink all the routes that the runtime passes data along.

Currently, only the `APP` and `EVENT MANAGER` footnote:[Event managers require special elm syntax only available to core components.] components are written in elm.
My hope is to write the `MANAGE STATE` component in elm too.

The runtime must use kernel code to interact with the world (detecting events and performing actions) though use of non-pure functions.
The rest of the elm runtime manipulates data -- this is the most complex and bug prone part but can be implemented using pure functions.
Writing this part of the runtime in elm will decrease the labour of porting elm to a new target and, by utilising the type system footnote:[
    The rules of elm type system are too restrictive so we will have to play some tricks (using kernel code) to bypass some of the security that the runtime provides.
    We can still use type checking to our advantage for the majority of the code we will write.
    If the compiler checks the majority of our code for us, we can focus our energy and our time on reviewing and documenting the minority code that breaks the rules.
    More on this later.
], will lead to a correct and robust elm runtime.

Harry.
